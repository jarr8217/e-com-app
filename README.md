This project showcases my ability to structure React components effectively, pass data through the component hierarchy, manage state for storing and updating store listings, and implement basic filtering using an onChange event handler. The styling was achieved using custom css. The beat list contains 12 beat listings, each is displayed in their own card that inclues a placeholder image where artist would place their logo or artwork, information of the beat like title, name, price and a description of the beat, and it has a button with a hover effect for adding beat to cart. It has a header section 
that contains the Store name "Beat Store" and a text input with a search button to filter.
